# TODO's

### Current TODO's

- [ ] Collect data from GDELT Project
    - [X] Make a list of all countries and the ways they can be referred to
        - [X] Crosslist with GDELT naming conventions
        - [X] Look at Mueller & Rauh's criteria for article selection
    - [X] Make a list of all relevant themes we want to track
        - [X] Look at GDELT documentation
        - [X] Check most frequently used themes
    - [ ] Start scraping operation
        - [X] Scrape % for all themes
        - [X] Write code to estimate time left of scraping 
        - [ ] Make code to retrieve data in chunks
        - [ ] Test with first chunk
        - [ ] Compress chunk
        - [ ] Make code to uncompress and combine chunks
- [ ] Write Research Proposal (deadline March 13)
    - [ ] Narrow down RQ based on data availability
    - [ ] Extract relevant overlapping literature from ARW research
    - [ ] Narrow down methods and write methods section

### Future TODO's

- [ ] Collect data from UCDP to use as predictors
    - [ ] Make list of all relevant predictors
    - [ ] Narrow down timeframe
    - [ ] Scrape all data from UCDP API
- [ ] Distinguish between local, regional and global news?
    - [ ] Look into literature for measures of closeness to classify regional news
        - [ ] See Schafer paper? Van Atteveldt?
    - [ ] Aggregate data based on local regional and global news
- [ ] Narrow down and substantiate relevant themes as predictors
    - [ ] Look at GDELT documentation
    - [ ] Check most frequently used themes
    - [ ] Check literature for relevant features in other prediction models
    - [ ] See Mueller & Rauh's paper, and [Correlates of War](https://correlatesofwar.org/) projects?
    - [ ] Make sure predictions are of the same resolutions as Mueller & Rauh's and ViEWS standard
- [ ] Merge GDELT and UCDP dataset
- [ ] Make prediction model
    - [ ] See replication data from Mueller & Rauh's paper
    - [ ] Evaluate different machine learning models
    - [ ] Compute prediction accuracy
- [ ] Compare local, regional and global models, and in combination with each other
    - [ ] See is there is a statistically significant difference in prediction accuracy (Answer RQ)
    - [ ] Check correlation and differences between different models
- [ ] Compare with baseline models (ViEWS, Mueller & Rauh)
- [ ] Retrieve results, make vizualizations
- [ ] Start writing process
